# Markdown Pipeline for Static Websites

## 1. About

This is a basic pipeline, written in Python, for converting a bunch of markdown files into html files while retaining their folder structures. Use it for generating static sites from a repository of writing and/or research material that uses Markdown.

It is deliberately minimal: small enough to fully own and maintain solo, with no theme or plugin ecosystem to track. It does not try to be MkDocs.

This repo (`md-pipeline/`) is where the pipeline is developed. It is not where you use it. The pipeline lives in `src/` and gets copied into your own research repo as `.tools/`. A `dummy-repo/` is included here for local testing.

## 2. Repository layout

After setup, your research repo will look something like this:

```
repo-root/
    README.md           ← used as homepage content
    some-docs/          ← research content dirs live at repo root; this is flexible.
        *.md            ← research content
    some-other-docs/
        *.md
    assets/             ← images and other non-md files
    .tools/             ← pipeline code
        build.py
        requirements.txt
        template.html
        style.css
        robots.txt
    .public/            ← build output
    .gitignore
```

The `.tools/` and `.public/` directories are dot-prefixed to keep them out of a markdown editor's file view.

The `.gitignore` must exclude `.public/`, such that the output of the pipeline is never committed. The host (e.g. Cloudflare Pages) runs the script and generates its own `.public/` fresh on every deploy. The `setup-tools.py` script adds this exclusion for you.

## 3. Usage
### 3.1. Set up the tool in your repo

First, you must copy the pipeline (`src/`) into your research repo as `.tools/`. Imagining that you have a `dummy-repo/` in use, run:

```sh
python setup-tools.py /path/to/dummy-repo
```

This will overwrite any existing `.tools/`, so re-running pushes the latest pipeline. It also ensures `.gitignore` excludes `.public/`.

### 3.2. Build

Run the build from your research repo root.

```sh
python .tools/build.py
```

Pass `--nav` to generate a sidebar navigation from the folder structure. Pass `--selfcheck` to run the pipeline's internal checks without building anything.

### 3.3. Serving locally

The site is served from `.public/`, which is the web root. You must serve from inside it so the root-absolute links resolve.

```sh
cd dummy-repo/.public && python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then go to http://localhost:8000/

### 3.4. Deploy on Remote Location

Host the research repo on GitHub (private) and connect it to remote location. If the hosting service supports GitHub integration, it will auto-build on every push to main.

Set the build command to `pip install -r .tools/requirements.txt && python .tools/build.py`, adding `--nav` if you want the sidebar. Set the output directory to `.public`, typed exactly.

## 4. How the build works

Conversion uses the `markdown` library with the `meta`, `toc`, `footnotes`, `tables`, and `fenced_code` extensions. The `toc` extension gives headings IDs so that `#anchor` links resolve.

The root `README.md` becomes the homepage, `index.html`. Every other `.md` file becomes a matching `.html` file, mirroring the source folder structure.

Internal links are rewritten on the rendered HTML (the `href` attribute) rather than the raw markdown, so links inside code blocks are left alone and reference-style links and footnotes are covered. Links become root-absolute, like `/notes/methods.html`, so navigation works from any folder depth. A link that resolves to the root `README.md` maps to `/index.html`.

Page titles, used for the `<title>` tag and for nav link text, resolve in priority order: the frontmatter `title` field, then the first `# H1` heading, then the filename.

Footnotes stay isolated per page. The build resets the markdown parser before each file, since the `footnotes` extension would otherwise leak definitions from one file into the next.

Non-markdown files such as images are copied through to `.public/`, preserving their structure.

Every build is a full clean rebuild: `.public/` is deleted and regenerated from scratch, so renamed or deleted sources leave no orphan HTML behind. For this reason you should never put hand-authored files in `.public/`.

The pipeline never modifies your source files. All rewriting happens on in-memory HTML and is written only under `.public/`.

The template carries a `noindex, nofollow` meta tag, and `robots.txt` (a block-everything list that also names known AI/search crawlers) is copied to the output root on every build. Both ship with the pipeline in `.tools/`, so they stay versioned with the source rather than hand-maintained. This is the site's primary anti-crawler defense; the repo being private is the other.

Dependencies are pinned to exact versions in `requirements.txt`, so the build container cannot silently pull an untested version of the markdown library.
